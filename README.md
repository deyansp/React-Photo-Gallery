# Overview
A React app that fetches images from an [API](https://picsum.photos/) and displays them to the user. When the user clicks on an image, a new fullscreen view of the photo is shown through an `ImgFrame` component. 
The photo thumbnails are contained in an `ImgTiles` component and the `Emotion` library is used for writing the app's CSS styles with JavaScript (contained in the `components.jsx` file).
